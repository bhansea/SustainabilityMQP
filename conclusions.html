          <h1>Contributions and Conclusions</h1>
          <p>
            The long-lasting nature of greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O, CO2) means that their cumulative impact continues to influence Earth's climate even after emission sources are reduced. This underscores the importance of sustained efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and implement strategies for carbon capture and sequestration to address both current and historical emissions. From earlier analysis, there was found to be an increasing trend of morbidity across a range of chronic health issues from around 2010-2021, potentially in relation to exposure to pollutants persisting in the atmosphere. If carbon neutrality efforts are not expedited sooner, these health impacts are projected to worsen, leading to an increase in the number of deaths each year. Thus, alongside environmental concerns, prioritizing action towards mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for safeguarding public health and ensuring clean, healthier air. <br>It has been made evident that current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are not yet sufficient in countering their adverse impacts. As the nation grapples with the imperative to mitigate climate change and transition towards a more sustainable future, it becomes essential to integrate diverse measures that span policy, technology, and societal engagement. While it is difficult to implement and enforce nationwide policies, it is possible to effect change within local communities. By fostering awareness and promoting sustainable practices through climate communication, individuals and communities can play a pivotal role in collectively reducing carbon footprints and cultivating a more environmentally conscious society.

          <h1>Contributions</h1>
          <p>
            Within WPI, a range of successful sustainability initiatives has emerged, aiming to reach carbon neutrality and enhance energy efficiency. These endeavors align with WPI's broader sustainability objectives, such as equipping graduates with the mindset and skills necessary to devise sustainable solutions to global challenges. Raising awareness and instilling eco-friendly values in students could foster a culture of sustainability and create the next generation of environmentally conscious leaders. However, despite these efforts, achieving this goal remains elusive. One explanation for which could be attributable to lack of climate communication. During this project, we found it challenging to access data and information regarding WPI’s sustainability initiatives. To address this issue, leveraging data science (DS) techniques for progress tracking and analytics could prove instrumental. By implementing DS methodologies, WPI can gain insights into the effectiveness of current sustainability initiatives, identify areas for improvement, and track progress towards carbon neutrality more effectively. Additionally, utilizing engaging visualizations to showcase these initiatives around campus can help facilitate engagement with sustainable practices among the campus community. The Office of Sustainability can play a pivotal role in spearheading these efforts by actively engaging students, faculty, and staff in sustainability-related activities and initiatives. Based on our challenges encountered during the research process, we recommend implementing these strategies to overcome barriers to information access and foster a culture of sustainability at WPI. <br>Additionally, WPI could benefit from implementing a centralized platform for sustainability-related matters in the form of a website. This platform would enhance data accessibility, highlight the importance of sustainability on campus, and establish WPI as a hub for sustainable innovations. As a part of this project, the team has created a website to encompass the work done for this project as well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of a website in facilitating communication and information sharing regarding sustainability initiatives at WPI.
          </p>
          <h1>Future Work</h1>
          <p>
            To build upon the groundwork laid by this project, future endeavors could focus on further developing the sustainability website as an educational resource for the community. Additionally, creating a WPI sustainability dashboard could serve as a vital tool for the Office of Sustainability, enabling comprehensive tracking and analysis of initiatives. Moreover, the development of a public, interactive dashboard could enhance climate communication and encourage greater involvement in sustainability efforts across the campus community. By continuing to innovate and collaborate, WPI can reinforce its commitment to sustainability and serve as a beacon of environmental stewardship in higher education.
