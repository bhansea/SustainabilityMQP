            <h1>Greenhouse Gasses (GHG)</h1>
            <p>
                Earth’s atmosphere is composed of about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases ​(National Geographic Society, 2023)​. Carbon dioxide and methane are a part of the 0.1 percent of other gases. Greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat, and notable examples of these gases are nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide. Increased emissions of greenhouse gases contribute to elevated concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in Earth's temperature. These concentrations are gauged in parts per million, parts per billion, and parts per trillion. To put it into perspective, one part per million corresponds to roughly one drop of water dispersed into about 13 gallons of liquid, approximately equivalent to the fuel tank capacity of a compact car ​(EPA, 2023)​.
            </p>
            <h2>Emissions</h2>
            <p>
              Nitrous Oxide, or N2O, poses a serious threat to our atmosphere. While it might not be as notorious as carbon dioxide or methane when it comes to global warming, it is a greenhouse gas that tends to fly under the radar. Also known as laughing gas, N2O is the forgotten greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. It is often overlooked because it doesn't linger in the atmosphere as long as some other greenhouse gases. However, its warming potential renders it problematic for our earth’s future. Pound for pound, N2O is about 300 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period ​(Brind'Amour & Lee, 2022)​. Many industrial activities contribute to the release of nitrous oxide into the air, with the main source being power plants.
              <br>
              Methane, is the more well-known gas in our atmospheric pollution, contributes major threats to both climate and health aspects. While it does not linger as long as carbon dioxide, this gas is an extremely potent gas—it may exit the atmosphere quickly, but its effects leave a lasting impact. Methane is more than 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a century. Short-term, it is over 80 times more potent, making it a powerful warming agent. (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2023) The primary sources of these emissions are livestock digestion, rice cultivation, and the extraction and burning of fossil fuels all contribute to methane's grand entrance into our atmosphere.
              <br>
              Despite comprising only 0.04% of Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide plays a significant role in global warming (Fecht, 2021). Naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's carbon cycle, carbon dioxide (CO2) is involved in the ongoing flow of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals. Unfortunately, human activities are disrupting this cycle by increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and impacting the ability of natural sinks, like forests and soils, to absorb and retain CO2. While various natural sources contribute to CO2 emissions, the substantial increase since the industrial revolution is primarily attributed to human-related activities. In 2021, carbon dioxide accounted for 79% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, as reported by the EPA. The main contributors to these emissions are transportation and the combustion of fossil fuels for energy ​(EPA, 2023)​.
            </p>
          <h2>Health Problems</h2>
          <p>
            There is more to the story when it comes to the long-term effects of methane and N2O emissions. These gases are not just a climatic problem. Methane is a Volatile Organic Compound, and when it reacts in the atmosphere, it forms ground-level ozone—a major component of smog ​(American Lung Association, 2022)​. Long term exposure and breathing in this mix of pollutants can lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, pre-term birth and even cancer for humans prone to exposure (Environmental Defense Fund, 2023). Continuous exposure to methane emissions has been shown to increase oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, which are all key risk factors for cardiovascular disease ​(Mendoza-Cano, et al., 2023)​. Individuals who live in a community with high methane emissions from coal fired power plants are at greater risk for developing heart disease.
            <br>
            Additionally, N2O is harmful to human health, as long-term exposure to this gas can lead to infertility in humans ​(CDC, 2018)​. So, methane and nitrous oxide are not just another greenhouse gas; they pose a dual threat, causing climate troubles and health problems, and it is crucial to recognize the importance of the effects on the atmosphere and our bodies.
            <br>
            While carbon dioxide is generally not considered directly harmful to human health, its impact on the environment, along with methane and nitrous oxide, can have consequences for human well-being. Despite CO2 not being an air pollutant itself, its warming potential can negatively affect human health. The influence of factors like increased CO2 emissions on climate change has notable implications for the prevalence and distribution of vector-borne diseases—illnesses transmitted by organisms acting as vectors, including mosquitoes, flies, and ticks. The ongoing shifts in climate, marked by daily, seasonal, or year-to-year variations, may lead to adaptations in vectors and pathogens, potentially expanding their geographical ranges. Consequently, this dynamic process poses health risks to human populations, as highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).
