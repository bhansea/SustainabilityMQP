          <h1>Greenhouse Gasses (GHG)</h1>
          <p>
              Earth’s atmosphere is composed of about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases ​(National Geographic Society, 2023)​. Carbon dioxide and methane are a part of the 0.1 percent of other gases. Greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat, and notable examples of these gases are nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide. Increased emissions of greenhouse gases contribute to elevated concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in Earth's temperature. These concentrations are gauged in parts per million, parts per billion, and parts per trillion. To put it into perspective, one part per million corresponds to roughly one drop of water dispersed into about 13 gallons of liquid, approximately equivalent to the fuel tank capacity of a compact car ​(EPA, 2023)​.
          </p>
          <h2>Emissions</h2>
          <p>
            Nitrous Oxide, or N2O, poses a serious threat to our atmosphere. While it might not be as notorious as carbon dioxide or methane when it comes to global warming, it is a greenhouse gas that tends to fly under the radar. Also known as laughing gas, N2O is the forgotten greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. It is often overlooked because it doesn't linger in the atmosphere as long as some other greenhouse gases. However, its warming potential renders it problematic for our earth’s future. Pound for pound, N2O is about 300 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period ​(Brind'Amour & Lee, 2022)​. Many industrial activities contribute to the release of nitrous oxide into the air, with the main source being power plants.
            <br>
            Methane, is the more well-known gas in our atmospheric pollution, contributes major threats to both climate and health aspects. While it does not linger as long as carbon dioxide, this gas is an extremely potent gas—it may exit the atmosphere quickly, but its effects leave a lasting impact. Methane is more than 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a century. Short-term, it is over 80 times more potent, making it a powerful warming agent. (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2023) The primary sources of these emissions are livestock digestion, rice cultivation, and the extraction and burning of fossil fuels all contribute to methane's grand entrance into our atmosphere.
            <br>
            Despite comprising only 0.04% of Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide plays a significant role in global warming (Fecht, 2021). Naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's carbon cycle, carbon dioxide (CO2) is involved in the ongoing flow of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals. Unfortunately, human activities are disrupting this cycle by increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and impacting the ability of natural sinks, like forests and soils, to absorb and retain CO2. While various natural sources contribute to CO2 emissions, the substantial increase since the industrial revolution is primarily attributed to human-related activities. In 2021, carbon dioxide accounted for 79% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, as reported by the EPA. The main contributors to these emissions are transportation and the combustion of fossil fuels for energy ​(EPA, 2023)​.
          </p>
          <h2>Health Problems</h2>
          <p>
            There is more to the story when it comes to the long-term effects of methane and N2O emissions. These gases are not just a climatic problem. Methane is a Volatile Organic Compound, and when it reacts in the atmosphere, it forms ground-level ozone—a major component of smog ​(American Lung Association, 2022)​. Long term exposure and breathing in this mix of pollutants can lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, pre-term birth and even cancer for humans prone to exposure (Environmental Defense Fund, 2023). Continuous exposure to methane emissions has been shown to increase oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction, which are all key risk factors for cardiovascular disease ​(Mendoza-Cano, et al., 2023)​. Individuals who live in a community with high methane emissions from coal fired power plants are at greater risk for developing heart disease.
            <br>
            Additionally, N2O is harmful to human health, as long-term exposure to this gas can lead to infertility in humans ​(CDC, 2018)​. So, methane and nitrous oxide are not just another greenhouse gas; they pose a dual threat, causing climate troubles and health problems, and it is crucial to recognize the importance of the effects on the atmosphere and our bodies.
            <br>
            While carbon dioxide is generally not considered directly harmful to human health, its impact on the environment, along with methane and nitrous oxide, can have consequences for human well-being. Despite CO2 not being an air pollutant itself, its warming potential can negatively affect human health. The influence of factors like increased CO2 emissions on climate change has notable implications for the prevalence and distribution of vector-borne diseases—illnesses transmitted by organisms acting as vectors, including mosquitoes, flies, and ticks. The ongoing shifts in climate, marked by daily, seasonal, or year-to-year variations, may lead to adaptations in vectors and pathogens, potentially expanding their geographical ranges. Consequently, this dynamic process poses health risks to human populations, as highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).

          <h1>Current Energy Consumption and Production Regulations and Effort</h1>
          <p>
            In this section, we will discuss three pivotal initiatives that significantly influence environmental policies in the United States: The Clean Air Act, the Clean Power Plan, and the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. These initiatives are essential components of the nation's commitment to addressing climate change, mitigating air pollution, and fostering sustainable energy practices. Understanding the intricacies of these measures is crucial for navigating the complex landscape of environmental policy, as they play a vital role in shaping the future of public health, energy production, and overall environmental well-being.
          </p>
          <h2>Clean Air Act</h2>
          <p>
            The Clean Air Act stands as a comprehensive federal law that plays a pivotal role in regulating air emissions from both stationary and mobile sources. Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Act encompasses a multifaceted approach to air quality management. One of its primary objectives is the establishment of standards for ambient air quality, aimed at reducing outdoor concentrations of pollutants responsible for smog, haze, and acid rain ​(EPA, 2007)​. By defining and enforcing these standards, the legislation seeks to safeguard public health and the environment from the detrimental effects of air pollution. In addition to regulating general air quality, the Clean Air Act addresses the emissions of hazardous air pollutants. Special attention is given to substances known or suspected to cause cancer, with stringent regulations in place to limit their release into the atmosphere ​(EPA, 2007)​. This aspect of the Act underscores a commitment to minimizing the health risks associated with exposure to toxic air contaminants.
            <br>
            The legislation also places emphasis on the protection of Earth's ozone layer. Specific provisions within the Clean Air Act are dedicated to phasing out the production and use of chemicals that pose a threat to the ozone layer. Recognizing the critical role of the ozone layer in maintaining habitable conditions on our planet, these measures contribute to global environmental preservation ​(Ritchie, 2023)​. As a dynamic and evolving piece of legislation, the Clean Air Act reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to address emerging challenges related to air quality and environmental protection.
          </p>
          <h2>Clean Power Plan</h2>
          <p>
            The Clean Power Plan, initiated during the Obama administration, represented a significant effort to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. This groundbreaking initiative established state-specific targets for emission reduction and actively promoted the adoption of renewable energy sources ​(Office of the Press Secretary, 2015)​. Despite its laudable goals, the plan encountered legal challenges and ultimately faced repeal under the Trump administration, which implemented a much weaker rule ​(Irfan, 2019)​.
            <br>
            Notably, the Clean Power Plan was the nation’s first legislature regulating power plants. Its primary goal was to significantly reduce carbon pollution from power plants, addressing both climate change and minimizing pollutants linked to the adverse effects of soot and smog on public health. Simultaneously, the plan aimed to stimulate innovation, development, and deployment within the clean energy sector, laying a foundation for a comprehensive, long-term strategy to address the climate crisis. The plan's strength lay in its provision of considerable flexibility and time for states and utilities to achieve the mandated pollution reductions. This approach aimed to optimize the balance between environmental protection and the maintenance of a reliable and affordable electricity supply for consumers and businesses. By allowing for adaptation to regional variations and unique circumstances, the Clean Power Plan sought to create a pragmatic framework for sustainable progress.
            <br>
            Crucially, the initiative recognized the enduring role of fossil fuels in America's energy landscape. Instead of eliminating them entirely, the Clean Power Plan aimed to enhance the cleanliness and efficiency of power plants using fossil fuels. Concurrently, it sought to expand capacity for zero- and low-emission power sources, promoting a diversified and resilient national energy portfolio ​(EPA, n.d.)​.
            <br>
            In summary, the Clean Power Plan was a forward-looking and comprehensive strategy that endeavored to balance the imperative of reducing emissions with the practicalities of maintaining a robust and adaptable energy sector. While its fate may have shifted with changing administrations, the plan's vision and principles remain influential in shaping ongoing discussions about the intersection of energy policy, environmental stewardship, and public health.
          </p>
          <h2>Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE)</h2>
          <p>
            Implemented during the Trump administration, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule aimed to guide states in developing their plans to enhance the efficiency of existing coal-fired power plants, diverging from the approach of setting specific emission reduction targets. In contrast to the Clean Power Plan, which established statewide emission reduction goals, the ACE rule focused on the individual level of power plants, striving to stimulate efficiency enhancements at this operational scale. Differing from the broader scope of the Clean Power Plan, the ACE rule primarily addressed emissions from power plants and placed less emphasis on broader strategies to promote renewable energy. This shift in focus made the ACE rule narrower in its regulatory scope ​(EPA, 2023)​.
            <br>
            The ACE rule triggered controversy, as critics argued that it fell short in adequately addressing climate change and raised concerns about potentially weaker emissions standards for power plants (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 2019; Irfan, 2019). Supporters, however, maintained that the rule offered increased flexibility to states and industries. In 2022, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the ACE Rule must be vacated as the Trump administration incorrectly interpreted Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, which deals with regulating emissions from existing sources (Detterman, Christensen, & Pilchen, 2021; Environmental Defense Fund, 2014).
