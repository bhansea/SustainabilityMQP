          <h1>Sustainability in Massachusetts</h1>
          <p>
            As we analyze the broader context of sustainability initiatives in Massachusetts, we transition from the micro-level of our college campus to the macro-level of statewide efforts. While WPI's campus initiatives are crucial, we recognize that the scope of impact extends far beyond our immediate environment. Understanding our role within the larger framework of statewide sustainability efforts is imperative for fostering meaningful change. By examining the initiatives undertaken by institutions across Massachusetts, we can glean insights into effective strategies, identify areas for improvement, and collaborate on a collective journey towards a more sustainable future. Through this comparative analysis, we aim to assess how our institution measures up against its peers in Massachusetts, driving us towards a more comprehensive understanding of our collective impact and the path forward for sustainable progress. <br>As discovered through our analysis of emissions across the United States using U.S. fuel emissions data from the EPA, Massachusetts is very relatively low emitting state compared to other US states. This is demonstrated in figure 6, which illustrates the average methane emissions in each state from 2011-2021, with Massachusetts highlighted in dark blue.
          </p>

            Despite Massachusetts' low emissions, it is crucial to identify avenues for collaborative action within our communities to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable environment locally, nationally, and globally. <br>Schools around Massachusetts that are comparable to WPI in campus and student body size, such as Bentley, and Tufts, have similar carbon neutrality goals. Bentley University, located in Waltham, Massachusetts, has seen a 76% decrease in their campus greenhouse gas emissions since 2008, according to University of New Hampshire’s SIMAP public reporting platform. In their Sustainability Plan, Bentley notes their initiatives to reduce Greenhouse gas emissions like energy efficiency upgrades to reduce fossil fuel use. Bentley’s upgrades include things like transitioning to solar array power and water heating efficiency technologies. The university also focuses their plan on transportation and even reducing the emissions generated by their study abroad programs. Tufts University, located in the greater Boston area, also utilizes an interactive public dashboard to track and visualize their progress towards their sustainability goals. This allows for improved tracking and analysis of Tufts’ initiatives and improves the climate communication within their community.  <br>We aimed to compare WPI to other universities in Massachusetts. As mentioned before, WPI is a partner with GreenerU. Thus, we wanted to see if collaborating with a sustainability firm impacted a college’s emissions. Communications were sent to three other universities that are partners with GreenerU in the Massachusetts area. The other three schools that we wrote to were also in Massachusetts but were not a part of the GreenerU ecosystem. We only heard from two schools. Boston College declined to participate; however, we did hear from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (UMA).

            UMA was gracious enough to respond to us. The representative of their Sustainability Office, Mr. Ezra Small, met with our team and provided us with data and directed us to the publicly available data on their website. This data included 2019, 2020, and 2022 source emissions data. Sources included “Diesel for Fleet,” “Gasoline for Fleet,” “Purchased Electricity,” and “Natural Gas.” Essentially, this data gave us insight into where the emissions were coming from. Additional data on scopes, or different categories of emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, were also provided. This broke down the source emissions data even more, as we could now categorize the different emissions. Similarly, Mr. Small gave us emissions scope data, for Scopes 1 and 2 (Stationary Fuel Combustion and Grid Electricity, respectively) going back to 2004. He mentioned that we will see that the coal fuel type only had data from 2004 to 2008, as in 2008 UMA stopped using a coal fired power plant and switched to a natural gas plant to heat their campus.  <br>We were also directed to UMA’s emissions reports that are publicly available on the UMA Office of Sustainability website. These patched any holes that we were left questioning. The reports outlined UMA's roadmap towards achieving carbon neutrality. For instance, in the realm of food and dining, UMA Dining backs the student division of the Food Recovery Network. This organization retrieves surplus food and distributes meals to a nearby homeless shelter throughout the academic year. Moreover, UMass Dining transforms excess food into fresh menu options and conducts informative events to promote awareness and reduce post-consumer waste ​(Rawson, 2023)​. By recovering surplus food and repurposing it into new menu items, UMA Dining minimizes the amount of food wasted, which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with food decomposition in landfills.
