          <h1>U.S. Policies and Regulations</h1>
          <p>
            In this section, we will discuss three pivotal initiatives that significantly influence environmental policies in the United States: The Clean Air Act, the Clean Power Plan, and the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. These initiatives are essential components of the nation's commitment to addressing climate change, mitigating air pollution, and fostering sustainable energy practices. Understanding the intricacies of these measures is crucial for navigating the complex landscape of environmental policy, as they play a vital role in shaping the future of public health, energy production, and overall environmental well-being. Then, we will discuss a couple of potential national regulations that could be implemented to curb emissions.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Current Energy Consumption and Production Regulations and Efforts

          <p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Clean Air Act</p>
          <p>
            The Clean Air Act stands as a comprehensive federal law that plays a pivotal role in regulating air emissions from both stationary and mobile sources. Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Act encompasses a multifaceted approach to air quality management. One of its primary objectives is the establishment of standards for ambient air quality, aimed at reducing outdoor concentrations of pollutants responsible for smog, haze, and acid rain ​(EPA, 2007)​. By defining and enforcing these standards, the legislation seeks to safeguard public health and the environment from the detrimental effects of air pollution. In addition to regulating general air quality, the Clean Air Act addresses the emissions of hazardous air pollutants. Special attention is given to substances known or suspected to cause cancer, with stringent regulations in place to limit their release into the atmosphere ​(EPA, 2007)​. This aspect of the Act underscores a commitment to minimizing the health risks associated with exposure to toxic air contaminants. <br>The legislation also places emphasis on the protection of Earth's ozone layer. Specific provisions within the Clean Air Act are dedicated to phasing out the production and use of chemicals that pose a threat to the ozone layer. Recognizing the critical role of the ozone layer in maintaining habitable conditions on our planet, these measures contribute to global environmental preservation ​(Ritchie, 2023)​. As a dynamic and evolving piece of legislation, the Clean Air Act reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to address emerging challenges related to air quality and environmental protection.

          <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Clean Power Plan</p>
          <p>
            The Clean Power Plan, initiated during the Obama administration, represented a significant effort to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. This groundbreaking initiative established state-specific targets for emission reduction and actively promoted the adoption of renewable energy sources ​(Office of the Press Secretary, 2015)​. Despite its laudable goals, the plan encountered legal challenges and ultimately faced repeal under the Trump administration, which implemented a much weaker rule ​(Irfan, 2019)​. <br>Notably, the Clean Power Plan was the nation’s first legislature regulating power plants. Its primary goal was to significantly reduce carbon pollution from power plants, addressing both climate change and minimizing pollutants linked to the adverse effects of soot and smog on public health. Simultaneously, the plan aimed to stimulate innovation, development, and deployment within the clean energy sector, laying a foundation for a comprehensive, long-term strategy to address the climate crisis. The plan's strength lay in its provision of considerable flexibility and time for states and utilities to achieve the mandated pollution reductions. This approach aimed to optimize the balance between environmental protection and the maintenance of a reliable and affordable electricity supply for consumers and businesses. By allowing for adaptation to regional variations and unique circumstances, the Clean Power Plan sought to create a pragmatic framework for sustainable progress. <br>Crucially, the initiative recognized the enduring role of fossil fuels in America's energy landscape. Instead of eliminating them entirely, the Clean Power Plan aimed to enhance the cleanliness and efficiency of power plants using fossil fuels. Concurrently, it sought to expand capacity for zero- and low-emission power sources, promoting a diversified and resilient national energy portfolio ​(EPA, n.d.)​. <br>In summary, the Clean Power Plan was a forward-looking and comprehensive strategy that endeavored to balance the imperative of reducing emissions with the practicalities of maintaining a robust and adaptable energy sector. While its fate may have shifted with changing administrations, the plan's vision and principles remain influential in shaping ongoing discussions about the intersection of energy policy, environmental stewardship, and public health.
          </p>
          <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Affordable Clean Energy Rule</p>
          <p>
              Implemented during the Trump administration, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule aimed to guide states in developing their plans to enhance the efficiency of existing coal-fired power plants, diverging from the approach of setting specific emission reduction targets. In contrast to the Clean Power Plan, which established statewide emission reduction goals, the ACE rule focused on the individual level of power plants, striving to stimulate efficiency enhancements at this operational scale. Differing from the broader scope of the Clean Power Plan, the ACE rule primarily addressed emissions from power plants and placed less emphasis on broader strategies to promote renewable energy. This shift in focus made the ACE rule narrower in its regulatory scope ​(EPA, 2023)​.  <br>The ACE rule triggered controversy, as critics argued that it fell short in adequately addressing climate change and raised concerns about potentially weaker emissions standards for power plants (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 2019; Irfan, 2019). Supporters, however, maintained that the rule offered increased flexibility to states and industries. In 2022, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the ACE Rule must be vacated as the Trump administration incorrectly interpreted Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, which deals with regulating emissions from existing sources (Detterman, Christensen, & Pilchen, 2021; Environmental Defense Fund, 2014).
